# Ben's FirstBackup
Ben’s First Backup is a simple utility for Microsoft Windows that will allow a user to back up their folders and files. You can also set a project name so you can backup the backup set anytime just by loading the backup set in the program or you can associate the backup set project in Windows allowing you to just double click the file to open it in the backup program.

Using the program
-----------------

To add files, click the “Add File” button the fille you select will add the list, you can also do the same for “Add Folder” button any folders you add will also includes any files or folders inside it so everything gets backed up.

Once you set a backup location you can then click the “Run” button eventing will then be compressed and saved to a zip file.

Other Stuff
-----------

This project was compiled in Microsoft Visual C# 2013 but should also work in latter editions without too much changing of the source, it also been compiled and runs fine on Microsoft Windows 10 and Microsoft Windows 11, The compression used in this app uses the Open Source library “Ionic.Zip” you can find out more information at the link here. [Ionic.Zip](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ionic.Zip)/

Feels free to fork the project and make your own changes and additions lets us know what you have done. I still got some ideas for this project that I will try and add among my other projects I am working on.

Some important notes
--------------------

You need to include the library from Ionic.Zip in the same folder as the application. You also need to make sure you have the .NET framework 4.5 or latter.
